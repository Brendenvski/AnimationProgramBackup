# 2D Animation Program
> Created By Brenden Villeneuve - UWaterloo

This program utilizes the Java Swing Builder in Netbeans. The program allows you to create drawings on a canvas whatever size(resolution) you please! You can save frames as you go and compile them in the end to a lopping GIF! While working, you can also save frames to your computer if you like a certain drawing(There are some examples below). In the end, you can choose your FPS(Frames Per Second) and export the file to a .gif file.

# How to Start:
*   Use git to pull this repository onto your system. 
*   Create an executable file from your favourite Java IDE.
*   (the program may also be compiled through NetBeans, instead of creating the executable)
*   Enjoy!

# How to Use:
*   Enter the size of photo you would like ( #pixels x #pixels ). 
*   Use the colour wheel, brush size chooser or the fill tool on the left side sandbox. 
*   When wanting to save a frame in a current state for the GIF, press "Save Next Frame", and the frame will be added to the queue.
*   When you have all of the desired frames ready for the GIF, use the FPS("Frames Per Second") Chooser and select the amount of loops and enjoy the loop!
*   At any time you may save a frame that you like in the top right corner, and choose either .png or .jpg file ectensions! 
*   When finished with the GIF editing, press export to save the .gif
*   Have fun!
